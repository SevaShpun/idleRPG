release 3:  
* added localization (ability to choose language still be in plans). It's a main thing in this version
* added russian translation, which still be imperfect, because of language complexity (also, English is not my native, so probably I didn't see the that much mistakes and inconsistencies in it)
* added buffs and effect over time spells 
* fixed potion buying
* fixed too often quest reset
* minor changes in texts, shown for user
* minor code improvements
